            I am trying to upload my dailylife record on youtube on regular
            basis to track how I have worked!
            <br />
            It is nothing special and sometimes I can just chill in nature, but
            I wanted to share the details to show my personality!
            <br />
            Everybody can fall down, but the most important thing is that we
            shouldn't stop and keep on running. I hope my this trivial youtube
            can cheer up someone who is also fighting hard for the futureü•∞

                This is a video I put all my time-lapsed studying clips
                together. I studied about 400 hours from Nov. 2022 to Dec. 2022
                and this video contains my hard working moment! Please Enjoy!

                This is my first vlog that I made last summer! Since it was my
                first time, I looked quite awkward and didn't even know well how
                to find a nice angleüòÇ But still my effort was sincere!

                This video is made around Christmas time. It shows well how hard
                I tried to balance between study and my close people. It was not
                easy but I am glad that I could achieve my goals‚ò∫Ô∏è
